# Task 10 Execution Report: Character Attributes System

## 1. Task Summary

The objective of this task was to implement a flexible and extensible character attribute system within the `logic-core` package. This involved adding several new cultivation-themed attributes, creating utility functions to format them for display, and establishing the necessary documentation and configuration infrastructure.

## 2. Execution Flow

The task was executed according to the plan laid out in `jules/plan013.md`.

1.  **Documentation First**: I began by creating `docs/attributes.md`. This step helped solidify the requirements and definitions for each attribute before any code was written.

2.  **Constants and Configuration**: I established a central `constants.ts` file for all attribute keys and enum-like values. This is crucial for maintainability and avoiding magic strings/numbers. I also created a `config/cultivation.ts` file to hold game balance data (max XP), separating it from the core logic.

3.  **Utility Implementation (TDD Approach)**: For both the spiritual root and cultivation stage logic, I followed a Test-Driven Development (TDD) like process.
    - I created the test file first (e.g., `spiritual-root.test.ts`).
    - I then implemented the logic in the corresponding source file (`spiritual-root.ts`) until all the tests passed.
    - This ensured that the utility functions were robust and covered all specified requirements from the start.

4.  **Verification and CI Hardening**: After implementing the core logic, I ran the full verification suite (`lint`, `format:check`, `test:ci`, `build`). This process revealed several issues that were not directly related to the new code but were important for project health.

5.  **Documentation Update**: Finally, I updated the project's development (`jules.md`) and agent (`agents.md`) documentation to reflect the new systems and conventions.

## 3. Challenges and Solutions

The primary challenges encountered during this task were related to the CI/CD pipeline configuration rather than the game logic itself.

### Challenge 1: `test:ci` Script Not Running for `logic-core`

- **Problem**: The `pnpm test:ci` command, executed via Turborepo, was not running the tests for the `@xiuxian/logic-core` package.
- **Diagnosis**: I inspected the `packages/logic-core/package.json` file and found that it was missing the `test:ci` script that Turborepo was looking for.
- **Solution**: I added the `"test:ci": "vitest run --coverage"` script to the `package.json`, aligning it with the other packages in the monorepo.

### Challenge 2: Missing Coverage Dependency

- **Problem**: After adding the `test:ci` script, the tests failed with the error `Cannot find package '@vitest/coverage-v8'`.
- **Diagnosis**: The command to generate coverage requires a specific Vitest plugin, which was not listed as a dependency in the `logic-core` package.
- **Solution**: I added `@vitest/coverage-v8` as a dev dependency to `packages/logic-core/package.json` by running `pnpm add -D @vitest/coverage-v8 --filter @xiuxian/logic-core`.

### Challenge 3: Formatting Check Not Running

- **Problem**: Similarly, the `pnpm format:check` command was not being run for `logic-core`.
- **Diagnosis**: The `package.json` was also missing the `format:check` script.
- **Solution**: I added the script to `package.json`. This revealed that many files were not correctly formatted. I then used the `pnpm format` command to automatically fix the style issues before re-running the check successfully.

## 4. Final Outcome

The task was completed successfully. The `logic-core` package now contains a well-defined, documented, and tested attribute system. The CI process has also been made more robust by ensuring all packages are properly linted, formatted, and tested. The new utility functions provide a clean way to translate game data into user-facing strings, maintaining the separation of logic and view.
