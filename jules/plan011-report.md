# Task Report: Character Card Implementation

## 1. Objective

The goal of this task was to implement a "Character Card" feature. This feature allows for the creation of characters with a predefined set of initial attributes, loaded from the character card's data.

## 2. Execution Summary

The task was executed following the plan laid out in `jules/plan011.md`. The implementation involved changes to the core logic in the `packages/logic-core` package, including updates to types, classes, and tests.

### 2.1. Type Definitions (`types.ts`)

-   A new type, `CharacterCardData`, was defined as `Record<string, number>` to represent the character's initial attributes.
-   The existing `CardData` interface was refactored into a TypeScript discriminated union. This is a significant improvement to the codebase's type safety, as it ensures that any card with `type: CardType.CHARACTER` will have a `data` property of type `CharacterCardData`.

### 2.2. Character Class (`character.ts`)

-   The `Character` class constructor was modified to accept a `name` string as a parameter, decoupling the character's name from the card's name.
-   Logic was added to the constructor to check if the provided card is a character card. If so, it iterates through the `data` (the `CharacterCardData`) and populates the character's `attributes` map.

### 2.3. CharacterManager Class (`character-manager.ts`)

-   The `createCharacter` method in `CharacterManager` was updated to accept the new `name` parameter.
-   The call to the `Character` constructor was updated to pass along the new `name`.

### 2.4. Testing

-   The unit tests for both `Character` and `CharacterManager` were updated to align with the new method signatures.
-   New tests were added to specifically verify that a character's attributes are correctly initialized from the `CharacterCardData` on the card.

## 3. Challenges and Solutions

The main challenge in this task was deciding on the best way to update the `CardData` type.

-   **Problem:** The original `CardData` interface had an optional `data: unknown` property, which was not type-safe.
-   **Solution:** I chose to refactor `CardData` into a discriminated union. This approach, while slightly more complex than just adding a new type, provides much stronger type guarantees and makes the code easier to reason about and maintain. This change was implemented smoothly and did not require modifications to other parts of the system, such as the `CardManager`, because the properties accessed by those other parts (`id`, `name`, `type`, etc.) were common to all members of the union.

## 4. Outcome

The Character Card feature was implemented successfully. Characters can now be created with initial attributes defined in their corresponding cards, and the core logic is covered by unit tests. The refactoring of `CardData` has also improved the overall quality of the codebase.
