# Plan 010 Report: Enhancing CharacterManager with Player Tracking

## Task Summary

The goal was to add functionality to the `CharacterManager` to specifically track the player character, enforce a single-player rule, and provide a direct method to access the player object.

## Implementation Process

1.  **Modified `CharacterManager`**:
    *   A new private property, `playerCharacterId: string | null`, was added to the class to store the ID of the player character.
    *   The `createCharacter` method was updated. It now checks if the character being created is of type `PLAYER`. If so, it verifies that a player does not already exist. If a player does exist, it throws an error. Otherwise, it sets the `playerCharacterId`.
    *   A new public method, `getPlayer(): Character | undefined`, was added. This method provides a convenient way to retrieve the player's `Character` object using the stored `playerCharacterId`.

2.  **Updated Unit Tests**:
    *   The test file `packages/logic-core/src/character-manager.test.ts` was updated with new test cases.
    *   Tests were added to verify that `getPlayer()` returns the correct player object when one exists and `undefined` when one does not.
    *   A test was added to ensure that attempting to create a second character of type `PLAYER` correctly throws an error, enforcing the single-player constraint.
    *   All tests were run and confirmed to pass, ensuring the new functionality is working as expected and has not introduced any regressions.

## Outcome

The `CharacterManager` has been successfully enhanced with player-specific logic. It now robustly manages a single player character and provides a simple API for retrieving it. The changes are fully tested and ready for integration.
