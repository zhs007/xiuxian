# Plan 009 Report: Refactoring "Role" to "Character"

## Task Summary

Following the initial implementation of the `Role` and `RoleManager` classes, a request was made to refactor these names to `Character` and `CharacterManager` for better semantic clarity. This report details the execution of that refactoring task.

## Implementation Process

1.  **File Renaming**: All relevant files in `packages/logic-core/src` were renamed:
    *   `role.ts` -> `character.ts`
    *   `role-manager.ts` -> `character-manager.ts`
    *   `role.test.ts` -> `character.test.ts`
    *   `role-manager.test.ts` -> `character-manager.test.ts`

2.  **Code Refactoring**: A comprehensive search-and-replace was performed across the codebase.
    *   The `RoleType` enum in `types.ts` was renamed to `CharacterType`.
    *   The `Role` class was renamed to `Character`, and all associated type annotations were updated.
    *   The `RoleManager` class was renamed to `CharacterManager`, and all internal methods and properties were updated (e.g., `createRole` to `createCharacter`, `getAllRoles` to `getAllCharacters`).
    *   Both test files were updated to reflect the new class and type names.

3.  **Package Exports**: The main package entry point, `packages/logic-core/src/index.ts`, was updated to export from the newly renamed `character.js` and `character-manager.js` files.

4.  **Verification**: After the refactoring, the entire test suite was run using `pnpm test`. All tests passed, confirming that the changes were applied correctly and did not introduce any regressions.

## Outcome

The refactoring was completed successfully. The `logic-core` package now uses the more intuitive `Character` and `CharacterManager` naming convention, improving the overall readability and maintainability of the code. All functionality remains intact as verified by the unit tests.
