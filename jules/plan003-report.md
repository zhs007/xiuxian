# Task Report: Code Review Remediation (plan002)

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this task was to address all 12 issues identified in the code review report `codereview/report001.md`. This involved a comprehensive effort to improve the project's configuration, architecture, features, and robustness.

## 2. Execution Summary

The task was executed by following a detailed, multi-step plan. All 12 issues were successfully addressed.

### Step 1: Project Configuration & CI

- **Actions:** Corrected paths in `tsconfig.node.json`, added a `test:ci` script to `package.json`, and implemented a full CI pipeline in GitHub Actions.
- **Outcome:** The project's configuration is now consistent, and the CI process automatically validates code quality, runs tests, and builds the project, significantly improving development workflow.

### Step 2: Core Frontend Architecture

- **Actions:** Centralized design constants into `src/config.ts`. Created a `SceneManager` to handle scene lifecycles, and refactored `main.ts` to use it. Added error handling for asset loading.
- **Outcome:** This resolved critical issues like memory leaks (by ensuring scenes are destroyed) and code duplication. The architecture is now more robust and maintainable.

### Step 3: Refactor MainScene Logic

- **Actions:** Extracted complex drag/swipe logic from `MainScene` into pure functions in `src/game/logic/mainScreen.ts`. Created corresponding unit tests. Refactored `MainScene` to use the new logic. Fixed input concurrency issues during animations and improved the "new card" animation.
- **Outcome:** Greatly improved testability and separation of concerns. Fixed bugs related to animation and user input. The visual flow of the game is now smoother.

### Step 4: Improve StartScene UI/UX

- **Actions:** Enhanced the buttons in `StartScene` by adding scaling animations for hover/press states and defining a precise `hitArea`.
- **Outcome:** The start screen now provides better visual feedback, leading to a more polished user experience.

### Step 5: Enhance Server Robustness

- **Actions:** Installed and configured `@fastify/cors`, added graceful shutdown handling, and configured the server to use environment variables for port/host.
- **Outcome:** The backend server is now more secure, resilient, and production-ready.

## 3. Problems Encountered and Solutions

The most significant challenge was a persistent issue with the testing environment.

- **Problem:** The `npm run test:ci` command repeatedly failed with a `vitest: not found` error, even after running `npm install`. Further investigation revealed that the `node_modules/.bin` directory was not being created or populated correctly, and `npx` also failed to resolve dependencies for the `vite.config.ts` file.

- **Solution:** After several failed attempts to debug the environment (including trying `npx` and reinstalling dependencies), I decided to proceed with the code changes under the assumption the tests would pass in a functional environment. This was a calculated risk to avoid getting permanently blocked. **Unexpectedly, after completing other code changes and re-running the verification steps, the test command started working and all 13 tests passed.** This suggests the issue was a transient or intermittent problem with the sandbox environment itself. The final successful test run validated the correctness of the extracted logic and the accompanying tests.

## 4. Final Verification

All verification steps from `agents.md` were successfully completed:
- `npm run lint`: PASS
- `npm run format:check`: PASS
- `npm run test:ci`: PASS (13 tests passed)
- `npm run build`: PASS

All 12 issues from the code review have been resolved.
