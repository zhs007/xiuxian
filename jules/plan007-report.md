# Report for Core Logic Implementation (plan007)

## Task Execution Summary

The goal of this task was to implement the core logic for a card game, including a card base class, card types, and a card manager.

The implementation was carried out according to the plan:
1.  **Card Types**: Defined in `packages/logic-core/src/types.ts`.
2.  **Card Class**: Implemented in `packages/logic-core/src/card.ts`.
3.  **Card Manager**: Implemented in `packages/logic-core/src/card-manager.ts`.
4.  **Sample Data**: Created in `apps/game/assets/cards/`.
5.  **Entry Point**: Updated in `packages/logic-core/src/index.ts`.
6.  **Testing**: A temporary test script was created and successfully executed.

## Problems Encountered and Solutions

The main challenge was setting up the testing environment for the `logic-core` package due to its nature as an ES module with Node.js dependencies.

1.  **`ts-node` with ES Modules**:
    *   **Problem**: Initially, `ts-node` failed to execute the TypeScript test file, throwing an `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION` error.
    *   **Solution**: After several attempts with different `ts-node` flags (`--esm`, `--transpiler`), I switched to a more robust testing strategy:
        1.  Compile the package first using `pnpm build`.
        2.  Run the test on the compiled JavaScript output.

2.  **TypeScript Build Errors**:
    *   **Problem**: The build failed because the `fs` and `path` modules were not recognized.
    *   **Solution**: Installed `@types/node` in the `logic-core` package to provide the necessary type declarations.

3.  **ESM Import Resolution**:
    *   **Problem**: The compiled JavaScript code failed to run because Node.js requires explicit file extensions in `import` statements for ES modules. The TypeScript compiler was not adding them by default.
    *   **Solution**:
        1.  I updated the `tsconfig.json` to use `"module": "NodeNext"` and `"moduleResolution": "NodeNext"`.
        2.  This triggered the compiler to enforce explicit file extensions, which I then added to all relative imports in the source code (e.g., `import './card.js'`).

4.  **Incorrect Test Path**:
    *   **Problem**: The test script failed with a "file not found" error because the relative path to the card assets was incorrect when running the test from the project root.
    *   **Solution**: Corrected the path in the test script to be relative to the project root.

After overcoming these hurdles, the tests passed, confirming the correctness of the implementation. The final code is clean, and the `logic-core` package is now a solid foundation for future development.
