# Report for Plan 005: Dependency Update and Documentation

## 1. Objective

The primary goal was to refactor the project to use the latest versions of its dependencies, based on the user's request to use "pnpm and Turborepo, trying to use the latest version." The task also included creating comprehensive documentation for the process.

## 2. Execution Summary

The project was already configured as a pnpm/Turborepo monorepo. The core of the work involved updating all dependencies and ensuring the project remained stable and functional.

### 2.1. Dependency Update

- **Action:** Ran `pnpm update --latest -r` to recursively update all dependencies in the workspace.
- **Result:** Several key packages were updated, including:
  - `turbo`: `2.0.9` -> `2.5.6`
  - `typescript-eslint`: `8.41.0` -> `8.42.0`
  - `gsap`: `^3.12.0` -> `^3.13.0`
  - `pixi.js`: `^8.12.0` -> `^8.13.1`
  - And others.

### 2.2. Verification and Remediation

After updating dependencies, a full suite of checks was performed as specified in `agents.md`. This process revealed and led to the resolution of a few minor issues.

- **`pnpm run lint`**: Passed without any issues.
- **`pnpm run format:check`**: Passed, but raised a `WARNING` from Turborepo about missing output files.
  - **Problem:** The `format:check` task in `turbo.json` was configured with an `outputs` field, but the script (`prettier --check`) does not produce any file output, leading to the warning.
  - **Solution:** Removed the `outputs` key from the `format` and `format:check` task definitions in `turbo.json`. The warning was successfully resolved upon re-running the command.
- **`pnpm run test:ci`**: Passed, but also raised a `WARNING` from Turborepo.
  - **Problem:** The `test:ci` task in `turbo.json` expected a `coverage/**` output, but the corresponding script in `apps/game/package.json` was `vitest run`, which does not generate a coverage report.
  - **Solution:** Modified the `test:ci` script in `apps/game/package.json` to `vitest run --coverage`. This aligned the script's output with Turborepo's expectation, and the warning was resolved.
- **`pnpm run build`**: Passed without any issues.

## 3. Outcome

The project's dependencies have been successfully updated to their latest versions. All verification checks (linting, formatting, testing, building) pass without errors or warnings, indicating the project is in a healthy state. The required plan and report documentation has been created. The next step is to update the main `jules.md` development document.
