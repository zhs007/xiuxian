# Project Development Documentation

This document provides detailed information about the project's architecture, development process, and solutions to technical challenges encountered.

## 1. Project Overview

This is a modern web game project built with a focus on maintainability, testability, and a clean separation of concerns.

- **Rendering:** [Pixi.js](https://pixijs.com/) v8
- **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Build Tool:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **Testing:** [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
- **Linting:** [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) v9
- **Formatting:** [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- **Server:** [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/)

## 2. Architecture

The project follows a strict separation between game logic and rendering.

### 2.1. Logic vs. Rendering

- **Game Logic:** Located in `src/game/logic`. These are plain TypeScript classes that contain the game state and rules. They have no knowledge of the rendering engine. This separation allows for:
  - Easy unit testing without a rendering environment.
  - The possibility of moving the logic to a server in the future.
- **Rendering:** Located in `src/scenes` and other rendering-related directories. These classes are responsible for displaying the game state. They are typically `PIXI.Container` subclasses that read data from the logic classes and update the visuals accordingly.

### 2.2. Directory Structure

- `assets`: Contains all static game assets like images and fonts.
- `jules`: Contains agent-related documentation, plans, and reports.
- `server`: A simple Fastify server for API endpoints.
- `src`: The main source code of the game client.
  - `game/logic`: Game logic.
  - `game/rendering`: (Currently unused, `scenes` is preferred) Components responsible for rendering specific game elements.
  - `scenes`: High-level containers for different parts of the game (e.g., Start Scene, Game Scene).
  - `types`: Shared TypeScript type definitions.
- `.github/workflows`: CI/CD configuration.

## 3. Development Process

### 3.1. Tooling and Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the Vite development server for the client.
- `npm run serve`: Starts the Fastify server in development mode with watch enabled, using `tsx`.
- `npm run build`: Compiles both the client and server for production.
- `npm run start`: Starts the production server after a build.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the code using ESLint.
- `npm run format`: Formats the code using Prettier.
- `npm run test`: Runs unit tests using Vitest.
- `npm run coverage`: Runs unit tests and generates a coverage report.

### 3.2. Technical Decisions and Challenges

#### ESLint v9 Compatibility

**Problem:** The initial setup required using ESLint v9. However, the latest stable versions of `@typescript-eslint/parser` and `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` at the time of setup were only compatible with ESLint v8.

**Solution:** After research, it was found that the alpha versions of the `@typescript-eslint` packages (`^8.0.0-alpha.31`) provided compatibility with ESLint v9. These versions were installed to satisfy the requirement. The configuration format was also updated to the new "flat config" (`eslint.config.js`).

#### Vitest `jsdom` Environment

**Problem:** The unit tests failed with the error `Cannot find package 'jsdom'`.

**Solution:** The `jsdom` package, required for the test environment specified in `vite.config.ts`, was not installed. Installing it as a development dependency (`npm install -D jsdom`) resolved the issue.

### 3.3. Architectural Patterns

#### Screen Scaling and Layout ("Fit" Scaling)

The game is designed for a portrait resolution of 1080x1920. To accommodate various device screens, a "Fit" scaling strategy is used.

- **HTML/CSS:** The main `index.html` body uses CSS Flexbox (`display: flex`, `justify-content: center`, `align-items: center`) to center the game canvas within the viewport. The page background is white, providing a letterbox effect if the viewport's aspect ratio does not match the game's.
- **Pixi.js:** The `main.ts` script contains a `resize` function that dynamically calculates the best scale factor to fit the 1080x1920 canvas within the window while maintaining its aspect ratio. It then sets the `style.width` and `style.height` of the canvas element accordingly. The Pixi app itself has a black background.

#### Simple Scene Management

A lightweight, event-driven scene manager is implemented in `main.ts`.

- **Structure:** A `currentScene` variable in `main.ts` holds a reference to the currently active scene. All scenes (e.g., `StartScene`, `MainScene`) must have an `update` method.
- **Transitions:** Scene transitions are triggered by events. For example, `StartScene` emits a `startgame` event when the "New Game" button is clicked. The `main.ts` file listens for this event, removes the `currentScene` from the stage, instantiates the new `MainScene`, adds it to the stage, and updates the `currentScene` reference.
- **Game Loop:** The main application ticker in `main.ts` calls `currentScene.update(delta)` on every frame, ensuring only the active scene is updated.

#### Asset Handling with Vite

Static assets like images are handled by Vite's asset import system.

- **Import:** An asset is imported into a TypeScript file, which provides a URL to the asset (e.g., `import cardImageUrl from '../../assets/cards/card.png'`).
- **Loading:** This URL is then passed to `PIXI.Assets.load()` to be loaded by the Pixi loader. This works seamlessly with Vite's development server and build process, ensuring assets are correctly bundled and referenced.

### 3.4. Code Review Remediation (report001)

Following a comprehensive code review (`codereview/report001.md`), several key architectural and functional improvements were implemented.

#### Singleton Scene Manager for Lifecycle Control

**Problem:** The previous scene management was manual and did not properly destroy old scenes, leading to potential memory leaks from orphaned event listeners and textures.

**Solution:** A singleton `SceneManager` was created (`src/scenes/SceneManager.ts`).

- **Lifecycle Management:** The manager's `switchScene` method now handles removing the old scene, calling `.destroy({ children: true })` on it to free up all associated resources, and adding the new scene to the stage.
- **Integration:** The main application entry point (`src/main.ts`) was refactored to use this manager, simplifying the scene transition logic and ensuring proper cleanup.

#### Logic Extraction for Testability

**Problem:** The core gameplay logic (card dragging, non-linear mapping, swipe detection) was tightly coupled with the rendering code inside `MainScene.ts`, making it impossible to unit test.

**Solution:**

- **Pure Functions:** All complex calculations were extracted into pure functions within a new file, `src/game/logic/mainScreen.ts`. These functions operate on a `CardDragState` object and return calculated values, with no side effects or knowledge of Pixi.js.
- **Unit Tests:** A corresponding test file, `src/game/logic/mainScreen.test.ts`, was created with a comprehensive suite of tests covering the extracted logic. This validates the behavior and protects against future regressions.
- **Refactoring:** `MainScene` was refactored to be a "dumb" view in this context. It now calls the pure logic functions to get transform values and applies them to the Pixi sprite, greatly reducing its complexity.

#### Server Robustness Enhancements

**Problem:** The Fastify server was minimal and lacked production-ready features.

**Solution:** The server (`server/index.ts`) was upgraded to include:

- **CORS:** Added the `@fastify/cors` plugin to handle cross-origin requests.
- **Graceful Shutdown:** Implemented listeners for `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` to allow the server to close existing connections gracefully before exiting.
- **Environment-based Configuration:** The server now uses `process.env` to configure its host and port, with sensible defaults (`0.0.0.0:3000`).

#### UI/UX and Animation Polish

- **Input During Animation:** Fixed a bug where the user could interact with the card while it was in the middle of its "fly out" animation. This was solved by setting `eventMode = 'none'` at the start of the animation and restoring it upon completion.
- **Smoother Animations:** The card's re-entry after a swipe was changed from an instant snap to a smooth animation, improving the game's visual flow.
- **Button Feedback:** Buttons in the `StartScene` now provide visual feedback (scaling) on hover and press, making the UI feel more responsive.

### 3.5. Dependency and Tooling Maintenance (plan005)

As part of routine maintenance, a full dependency upgrade was performed to ensure the project uses the latest stable versions of all tools and libraries.

#### Dependency Update

- **Action:** All dependencies across the monorepo were updated using `pnpm update --latest -r`.
- **Impact:** This brought key packages like `Turborepo`, `Pixi.js`, `GSAP`, and various ESLint plugins to their latest versions, ensuring access to new features and security patches.

#### Turborepo Configuration Tuning

**Problem:** During the verification process, Turborepo issued warnings for the `format:check` and `test:ci` tasks, stating that no output files were found.

**Solution:**

- For `format:check`, the task runs `prettier --check`, which only returns a status code and doesn't produce file outputs. The `outputs` key was removed from its definition in `turbo.json` to silence the warning.
- For `test:ci`, the task in `turbo.json` was configured to expect a `coverage/**` output, but the script in `apps/game/package.json` did not generate one. The script was updated from `vitest run` to `vitest run --coverage` to align the generated output with Turborepo's expectation.

These small fixes ensure a clean, warning-free CI pipeline.

### 3.6. Monorepo Refactoring (plan006)

This task focused on completing the separation of the `server` application from the `game` application within the monorepo.

#### Configuration Cleanup

**Problem:** Although the `server` code had been physically moved to its own package at `apps/server`, the TypeScript configuration for the `game` app (`apps/game/tsconfig.json`) still contained a reference to a local `server` directory in its `include` path. This created a discrepancy between the project's configuration and its structure.

**Solution:** The `apps/game/tsconfig.json` file was edited to remove the obsolete `"server"` entry from the `include` array. This change correctly reflects that the `game` package is a standalone frontend application and has no direct build-time dependency on the server code.

#### Verification and CI Robustness

**Problem:** During the verification phase, running `pnpm dev` at the root level via `turbo dev` failed with a `ERR_PNPM_NO_IMPORTER_MANIFEST_FOUND` error for the `@xiuxian/server` package, despite the `package.json` being present.

**Solution:** Investigation showed that running `pnpm dev` directly within the `apps/server` directory worked correctly. The issue appears to be a specific, complex interaction within `turbo`'s process execution for that script. As the individual packages could be built, tested, and run correctly, the root cause was deemed unrelated to the `tsconfig.json` cleanup and the core task was considered successful. This finding highlights a potential area for future investigation into the `turbo` and `pnpm` integration.
